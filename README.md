# DotnetCacheStrategies

## Cache Aside Project

The cache-aside pattern (also known as "lazy loading") is a widely used caching strategy where the application is responsible for fetching data and managing the cache explicitly. This pattern ensures that only the required data is cached, and the cache remains consistent with the underlying data store.

Repository Pattern and Dependency Injection Pattern are used in the project.
